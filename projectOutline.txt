**Context / Problem**

As a user of modern software platforms I am frequently being prompted to create passwords for different websites, tools, apps etc. and they all have different requirements for how to be “strong”

**Solution**

I am going to write a program that takes in a sequence of requirements and spits out a random password for me based on those inputs.

According to Microsoft, a strong password is:

- At least 12 characters long but 14 or more is better
- A combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols
- Not a word that can be found in a dictionary or the name of a person, character, product, or organization
- Easy for you to remember but difficult for others to guess. Consider using a memorable phrase like “6MonkeysRLooking^”. (doesn’t this contain words from the dictionary lol)

Once a password is created Microsoft also recommends:

- Use a unique password for each website. If crooks steal your account information from one site, they'll try to use those credentials on hundreds of other well-known websites, such as banking, social media, or online shopping, hoping you've reused the password elsewhere. That's called a "*Credential stuffing attack*" and it's extremely common.
- If you don’t want to memorize multiple passwords, consider using a password manager. The best password managers will automatically update stored passwords, keep them encrypted, and require multi-factor authentication for access. Microsoft Edge can remember your passwords for you and automatically fill them in for you when needed. See [Save or forget passwords in Microsoft Edge.](https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/microsoft-edge/save-or-forget-passwords-in-microsoft-edge-b4beecb0-f2a8-1ca0-f26f-9ec247a3f336)
- It's ok to write your passwords down, as long as you keep them secure. Don't write them on sticky notes or cards that you keep near the thing the password protects, even if you think they're well-hidden.

**MVP or MPP**

For the minimum viable product or minimum passable project my program must do the following:

- Take in a minimum number of characters required from the user
- Take in a maximum number of characters required from the user
- Take a yes / no for whether one uppercase letter is required
- Take a yes / no for whether one lowercase letter is required
- Take a yes / no for whether at least one numeral is required
- Assume no spaces are allowed
